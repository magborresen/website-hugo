      <description>&lt;p&gt;The µLevel is one of my pet projects that I started after needing a bed levelling feature on my 3D printer. I had built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766&#34;&gt;Hypercube 3D printer&lt;/a&gt; that I never really got working properly. So I ended up selling it and bought a Creality Ender 3 instead. This means that the project has been put on hold since it was designed pretty specifically to the Hypercube. However I might pick it up again. Never the less you can read more about it below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I have been working with 18650 battery cells that I got a ton of from an bike shop that had deemed them defective. I took the ebike batteries apart and tested each cell individually. Usually I would only find 1-2 cells per pack that was actually the culprit of the pack testing bad at the bike shop. This is out of a 40 cell pack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
