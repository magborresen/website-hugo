      <description>Now that there&amp;rsquo;s only 3 semesters left of my university career, we wanted to try something new. I have never worked with radio systems much and particularly not radar. Thus when the oppertunity to do a project within Numerical Scientific Computing, my prosective group member and I went to one of the professors in the communications department and asked if he had a project that we could work on. He suggested we could work on a target tracking radar system utilizing a track-before-detect (TBD) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Near Real Time Error Detection in 3D Prints</title>

      <description>My 6th’s semester was writing my bachelor thesis. I worked on a project for the thesis with 3 of my fellow students. I have a Creality Ender 3 3D printer at home that I use for my hobby projects. I had seen a few projects trying to use deep learning to give people a heads up whether their print was failing.
However the current methods would only tell you if the printer started making “spaghetti”.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Rescue Drone</title>

      <description>For our 5th semester project, my group and I chose to work on a project that I proposed. I had seen some attemps at making drones that could be used for avalanche rescue operations, but none of them seemed to work very well. So we decided that we would investigate and see if we could make such a drone ourselves. This was definitely one of the most extensive projects during my university studies.</description>

      <description>Looking back, my fourth semester project was kind of a stretch in terms of useability. We have to create something that we think is exciting, but also fullfills the study regulations. Sometimes, very funky projects is the outcome of that.
A little background before telling you about the project. AAU has multiple student run organization that builds different stuff or simply meet up to discuss different topics. I was very inspired by AAUSAT, which is a project to launch nanosatelittes build by students.</description>

      <title>HiFi Power Amplifier</title>

      <description>On my third semester we really started to dig down in all the fun analog electronics stuff. In fact we had a whole course about discrete components. So naturally our project was going to involve a lot of those. Our 5 man group decided on making a HiFi Amplifier. But because this being AAU, we had to have some sort of thoughts about the UN world goals in the project as well.</description>

      <title>EMC Testing Probe</title>

      <description>On the 2nd semester of my studies I was in a project group with 5 other students. Now we had dipped our toes in the water from the 1st semester and we had some more interesting project proposals. My group chose to go with a proposal for automating probe moves in an EMI/EMC testing chamber.
The project was done in collaboration with FORCE Technology, who does EMC/EMI testing for other companies.</description>
