      <title>Track-Before-Detect FMCW Radar Algorithm Exploration</title>

      <description>Now that there&amp;rsquo;s only 3 semesters left of my university career, we wanted to try something new. I have never worked with radio systems much and particularly not radar. Thus when the oppertunity to do a project within Numerical Scientific Computing, my prosective group member and I went to one of the professors in the communications department and asked if he had a project that we could work on. He suggested we could work on a target tracking radar system utilizing a track-before-detect (TBD) algorithm.</description>

      <description>or a few years I have been intrigued by the badge life industry and the PCB artwork enthusiasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do my own PCB artwork but I didn&amp;rsquo;t just want to do it on any old PCB. By that I mean, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna take one of my practical designs and make an artwork out of the traces, silkscreen etc. I wanted to make a PCB entirely as the artwork.</description>

      <title>µLevel Pressure Sensor</title>

      <description>The µLevel is one of my pet projects that I started after needing a bed levelling feature on my 3D printer. I had built a Hypercube 3D printer that I never really got working properly. So I ended up selling it and bought a Creality Ender 3 instead. This means that the project has been put on hold since it was designed pretty specifically to the Hypercube. However I might pick it up again.</description>

      <title>Robustness Testing of a CNN in Acoustic Scene Classification</title>

      <description>The first semester of the master studies in Signal Processing was more or less an introduction to signal processing within audio systems. We had a few project proposals from external companies. My project group and I (4 people in total), found a few of the proposals from the company RTX A/S interesting. RTX works a lot in the audio domain and develops a great deal of headset technology. They were interested in some student investigating more into classification of acoustic scenes using neural networks.</description>

      <description>For a few years now, I have been working with 18650 battery cells that I got a ton of from an bike shop that had deemed them defective. I took the ebike batteries apart and tested each cell individually. Usually I would only find 1-2 cells per pack that was actually the culprit of the pack testing bad at the bike shop. This is out of a 40 cell pack.</description>

      <title>Near Real Time Error Detection in 3D Prints</title>

      <description>My 6th’s semester was writing my bachelor thesis. I worked on a project for the thesis with 3 other people. I have a Creality Ender 3 3D printer at home that I use for my hobby projects. I had seen a few projects trying to use deep learning to give people a heads up whether their print was failing. But they would only tell you if the printer started making “spaghetti”.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Rescue Drone</title>

      <description>For our 5th semester project, my group and I chose to work on a project that I proposed. I had seen some attemps at making drones that could be used for avalanche rescue operations, but none of them seemed to work very well. So we decided that we would investigate and see if we could make such a drone ourselves. This was definitely one of the most extensive projects during my university studies.</description>

      <description>Looking back, my fourth semester project was kind of a stretch in terms of useability. We have to create something that we think is exciting, but also fullfills the study regulations. Sometimes, very funky projects is the outcome of that.
A little background before telling you about the project. AAU has multiple student run organization that builds different stuff or simply meet up to discuss different topics. I was very inspired by AAUSAT, which is a project to launch nanosatelittes build by students.</description>

      <title>HiFi Power Amplifier</title>

      <description>On my third semester we really started to dig down in all the fun analog electronics stuff. In fact we had a whole course about discrete components. So naturally our project was going to involve a lot of those. Our 5 man group decided on making a HiFi Amplifier. But because this being AAU, we had to have some sort of thoughts about the UN world goals in the project as well.</description>

      <title>EMC Testing Probe</title>

      <description>On the 2nd semester of my studies I was in a project group with 5 other students. Now we had dipped our toes in the water from the 1st semester and we had some more interesting project proposals. My group chose to go with a proposal for automating probe moves in an EMI/EMC testing chamber.
The project was done in collaboration with FORCE Technology, who does EMC/EMI testing for other companies.</description>

      <description>The first semester project I did was in a project group with 6 of my fellow students. The frame of the project was to get started with electronics, microcontrollers and single board computers. Being at Aalborg University, the project also had to relate the the UN World Goals. We decided on a project that would help uncover hearing disabilities and educate young people in the public schools. The below is the abstract from the project report</description>
