      <description>or a few years I have been intrigued by the badge life industry and the PCB artwork enthusiasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do my own PCB artwork but I didn&amp;rsquo;t just want to do it on any old PCB. By that I mean, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna take one of my practical designs and make an artwork out of the traces, silkscreen etc. I wanted to make a PCB entirely as the artwork.</description>

      <description>The µLevel is one of my pet projects that I started after needing a bed levelling feature on my 3D printer. I had built a Hypercube 3D printer that I never really got working properly. So I ended up selling it and bought a Creality Ender 3 instead. This means that the project has been put on hold since it was designed pretty specifically to the Hypercube. However I might pick it up again.</description>

      <description>For a few years now, I have been working with 18650 battery cells that I got a ton of from an bike shop that had deemed them defective. I took the ebike batteries apart and tested each cell individually. Usually I would only find 1-2 cells per pack that was actually the culprit of the pack testing bad at the bike shop. This is out of a 40 cell pack.</description>
