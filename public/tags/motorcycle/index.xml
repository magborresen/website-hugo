      <description>When I first go to Munich, I was pretty determined that I was gonna buy a motorcycle to ride in the German and Austrain alps with. I spent quite some time looking at ebay for offers and one day I found this amazing tornado red (yes that is the actual color name) T509 Speed Triple from 1998.
I noticed on the ebay add that it had quite a lot of stickers on it, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like, but I bought it anyway and only ended up paying 1600 euros for it.</description>
