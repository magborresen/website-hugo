      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first go to Munich, I was pretty determined that I was gonna buy a motorcycle to ride in the German and Austrain Alps with. I spent quite some time looking at eBay for offers and one day I found this amazing tornado red (yes that is the actual color name) T509 Speed Triple from 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed on the eBay ad that it had quite a lot of stickers on it, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t like, but I bought it anyway and only ended up paying 1600 euros for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
